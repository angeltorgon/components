# Components - Vision

_*Developing and communicating a long-term vision both justifies the work and guides the work._

## Reusability

The best code is no code at all [[0]](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-best-code-is-no-code-at-all), but the second best thing is reusable code. Component-driven development replaces one-off solutions with building a cross-application asset with compounding value. A well encapsulated component is plug-n-play with sane defaults.

## Accessibility

The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect [[1]](https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility). Make components accessible. Use best practices for supporting a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive ability.
